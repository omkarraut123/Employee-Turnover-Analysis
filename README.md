#Predicting Employee Turnover.

Project Problem Statement:

Employee turnover refers to the percentage of workers who leave an
organization and are replaced by new employees. It is very costly for
organizations, where costs include but not limited to : separation, vacancy,
recruitment, training and replacement. On average, organizations invest
between four weeks and three months of training new employees. This
investment would be a loss for the company if the new employee decided to
leave the first year. Furthermore, organizations such as consulting firms
would suffer from deterioration in customer satisfaction due to regular
changes in Account Reps and /or Consultants that would lead to the loss of
businesses with clients.

Solution:

In this project, we’ll work on simulated HR data from kaggle to build a
classifier that helps us predict what kind of employees will be more likely to
leave given some attributes. Such classifier would help an organization
predict employee turnover and be pro-active in helping to solve such a costly
matter. We’ll restrict ourselves to use the most common classifiers: Random
Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression
and Support Vector Machine(SVM).
